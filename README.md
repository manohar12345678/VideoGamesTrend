# Data set
Here we have a data set called vgsales-2016. This data set is basically the sales of the various video games on different platforms over the years.

##Agenda
Our Agenda is to find two things
1. Idenfying the average globale sales before 2005 and after 2005

>Based on a Year_of_Release column which will produce a post dataset with a additional column to say if the game was in trend before or after 2005
